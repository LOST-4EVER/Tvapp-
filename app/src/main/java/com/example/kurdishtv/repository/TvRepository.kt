/**
 * Whether a freshly merged list should replace what is already on disk.
 *
 * A refresh that produces *fewer* channels than the cache almost always means
 * some source failed rather than that the catalogue genuinely shrank. The
 * bundled offline catalogue is a floor, so a merge can only get this small by
 * losing a remote source — and a lost source is a temporary condition, while
 * the cache is treated as current for [TvRepository.CACHE_FRESH_MS].
 *
 * Writing it anyway is how one bad refresh becomes thirty minutes of missing
 * channels: the gap is written to disk, the next cold start reads the cache as
 * fresh, and nothing prompts a refetch. The viewer sees a smaller grid and no
 * way to tell that a transient network blip did it.
 *
 * The trade is accepted in the other direction too: if a viewer removes a custom
 * playlist, its channels linger in the cache until it expires. That is the
 * right way round — a few extra channels that stop appearing after one interval
 * is a far smaller harm than hundreds that vanish and stay vanished.
 *
 * Pinned by [com.example.CachePolicyTest] so the comparison cannot be silently
 * inverted, which is the one way this could be edited into the bug it prevents.
