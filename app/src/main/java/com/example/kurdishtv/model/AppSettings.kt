/**
 * Which of the app's two layout families to present.

 * The app draws a genuinely different interface for a television and for a handheld —
 * a ten-foot grid with large cards, a navigation rail, a channel sidebar and D-pad
 * focus rings, against a compact touch-first layout — and every layout decision reads
 * `LocalIsTv` rather than the window size, because a TV box and a tablet report
 * comparable sizes.
 *
 * [AUTO] keeps that single signal: the device's declared `uiMode`, which is right
 * almost always. The two overrides exist because it is not right always, and the two
 * cases that come up are not exotic:
 *
 *  - Plenty of Android TV boxes, projectors and HDMI sticks declare a phone or tablet
 *    `uiMode`. The app then draws the compact touch layout on the one device with the
 *    most pixels to spend, and every card is a thumbnail from a sofa.
 *  - Conversely, a tablet or a phone on a stand with a Bluetooth keyboard is being
 *    driven with a D-pad from across the room, and wants the room-sized targets.
 *
 * So this is a user-facing override of a heuristic, not a second code path: nothing
 * downstream branches on anything but `LocalIsTv`, which this setting resolves.
